# DEVELOPMENT TRACKER

## [DATE: YYYY-MM-DD] Authentication System Milestone

### Summary
- Completed implementation of a robust, industry-standard authentication system for UPID CLI.
- Features:
  - Interactive onboarding wizard (`upid onboarding onboard`) for seamless setup.
  - Support for OIDC/SSO (device code, browser flow; Azure, Google, Okta, Auth0, custom).
  - Support for SAML (browser-based login, assertion handling).
  - Support for LDAP/Active Directory (username/password, session management).
  - Automatic kubectl detection for individual users.
  - Custom/bearer token support for organizations.
  - Auto-export/save of configuration after onboarding.
  - Comprehensive CLI help, status, and troubleshooting commands.
- All code paths, configuration scenarios, and CLI commands validated with automated tests.
- All flows pass in simulated/test environment.

### Future Action Item
- **End-to-end live validation with real enterprise credentials (OIDC, SAML, LDAP, SSO) to be performed in a real environment.**
- This will require actual enterprise endpoints and user interaction for device code/browser flows.

**This milestone is parked for now. Revisit for live validation and further enterprise integration as needed.**
