## üîç Core Features Analysis (W5H+H Framework)

### 1. Pod Idle Time Detection & Analysis

#### **WHAT** is Pod Idle Time?
- **Definition**: The percentage of time a pod is not performing meaningful business work despite being in a "running" state
- **Technical Measurement**: Correlation of resource requests vs actual business activity over time
- **Business Meaning**: Waste identification - paying for allocated resources that aren't generating business value

#### **WHY** do we need Pod Idle Time Detection?
- **Primary Problem**: Organizations waste 40-60% of Kubernetes costs on idle or underutilized resources
- **Business Impact**: Direct cost savings opportunity - idle resources represent pure waste
- **Operational Challenge**: Traditional monitoring shows "healthy" pods that aren't doing business work
- **Financial Justification**: Every 1% of idle time detected saves thousands in monthly infrastructure costs

#### **WHO** benefits from Pod Idle Time Detection?
